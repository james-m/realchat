SSION STATEMENT
Yesterday’s blog app is today’s chat server.

In the past, a blog example was enough to show of a web framework, but as ajax has taken over the web front end, more sophisticated backends have emerged, implementing techniques like highly concurrent, non blocking socket I/O to keep up. Thus it seems like if you really want to show off what a framework can do, an ajaxified chat server is where its at. 

Many of these examples are just the right level to give someone a taste of what that framework provides. Yet as I’ve consumed these examples I’m almost always left wanting more details of a how they would be deployed in a real world, highly scalable, highly available way?

This project is my attempt to do that. We’re going to create an ajaxified web chat service with a backend that is distributed so we can scale linearly and provide higher fault tolerance (basically, all the cool things distributed systems give you). We’re also gonna pull together no one piece of technology, but a few, as you would need to in the real world. 

The goal is to eventually deploy it on AWS across a few running instances to prove the architecture’s viability.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
I like the idea of micro frameworks, or very compact, loosely coupled library of components that you pick and choose from to create your overall architectures. A micro framework approach has the following benefits:

a) because they’re so loosely coupled, you have more choose for any given component. 
b) smaller, bite-sized pieces of code are easier to digest, and the more you digest of what a framework is doing under the covers, the better able you’ll be to diagnose problems. 

* gevent for networking / parallelism (http://www.gevent.org/) - I <3
* greenlets. I cut my teeth with them really haven’t found anything better for
* optimizing for I/O parallelism (which is what all this non-blocking sockets
* are about right?)
* YARO for http request object (http://lukearno.com/projects/yaro/) - A nice
* lightweight object for turning a wsgi http request into something consumable
* in python. 
* bottle (http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) - for http request routing. Again a
* simple framework where were only gonna use a piece of it to do what we need. 
* mysql (http://www.mysql.com/) - Yep, the old work horse is still the best
* when it comes to persisting bytes to disk. 

That’s about all I can think of for now. I *might* do something like mustache (http://mustache.github.com/) if I decide I need templating, but this project is mainly focused on a scalable backend so we’ll see.
